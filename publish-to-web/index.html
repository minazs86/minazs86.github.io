    <meta name="description" content="An experimental online experience exploring the speculative nature of sensory data in the sciences. It speculates on the sociology of microbiomes, using the way their behaviors are similar to humans with metaphors such as camouflage as anti-surveillance, for example. The experiments are part of continuing research on the nature of truth and reality.  The experiments are part of continuing research on the phenomena of translation and data interpretation. The research will ultimately culminate in a gallery exhibit and printed work. This project is partially funded by the BioArts Residency program at the University City Science Center in Philadelphia, PA."/>
