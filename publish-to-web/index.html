    <meta name="description" content="Three scales of perception: the mundane, the microscopic, the monumental. Parallel yet triune realities. From empyrean to inglorious, analogous structures mirror and expose the speculative nature of sensory data. The products of the lab, raw, and not yet rendered into information > data synthesized by human minds, human bodies, human intentions. Interpretation is tricky, fuzzy. The translator’s role is silent but not benign, she is a narrator, a curator.


ACT I
Speculate on what may unfold. Obscured forces set events in motion. The director, a conspicuous absence? Possibilities of infinite outcomes. 

ACT II
Am i still in the audience, or on a stage? I can’t see behind the curtain. Subject and object in disagreement. 

ACT III
Not what i expected. Was it a rehearsal or a game? Almost the same again, save minor errors. A new script is penned to include them.

This is an experimental online experience exploring the speculative nature of sensory data in the sciences. It speculates on the sociology of microbiomes, using the way their behaviors are similar to humans with metaphors such as camouflage as anti-surveillance, for example. 

The experiments are part of continuing research on the phenomena of translation and data interpretation, and nature of truth and reality at large. Part film, part essay, there is no one outcome in the series of interaction that it offers. It is designed to have one beginning, but many outcomes. The sequence of interactions emphasizes the repetition and randomization in the chain of biological data such as amino acid or dna sequences. 

These 20 theses in combination colonize some of the scientific ideas and sociocultural metaphors to speculate about the nature of evolution. Some of the experiments are inspired by the anomalies found in the sciences including medicine, biotechnology, neurobehavioral psychology. 

You are not supposed to see the science in it. It is a choreographed dance with chaos, the puzzles are an attempt to bring order in a cosmos of secrets, to unlock the treasure seeking impulses, and offer an elaborate differential diagnosis on life, survival, and nature of evolution.

I am  hoping to inspire the spectators: 
to question the scientific act of translation: the translation of raw data into information and the translation of information into “truth.”
to gaze from a distance, and consider the shift in perspective when reality is viewed from macro and micro scales. 
to think about metaphor as an act of translation.
to consider the sociology of the microcosmos: how behaviors like camouflage and deception are means of survival. Is there a psychopathy to survival?
to think about life as an algorithm: a series of interactions formed by relationships, wherein intelligence is formed by continual input.
to consider chaos necessary for life: as the random seed in dna that allows evolution, as the means necessary to upset cultural comfort and restructure outmoded social norms, and as the explosive counterforce to entropy in the galactic cycle of creation.

This project is partially funded by the BioArts Residency program at the University City Science Center in Philadelphia, PA.
