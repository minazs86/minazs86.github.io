What a <span class="one animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-4s ">(adjective)</span> day today turned out to be! I thought I was running late 
for <span class="two animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-7s ">(verb)</span> practice because my alarm clock stopped. 
		<span class="three animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-8s ">“(Exclamation)”</span> I shouted when I saw it. 
		I jumped out of bed and threw on my 
		<span class="four animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-12s ">(animal)</span> slippers. I 
		<span class="five animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-16s ">(adverb)</span> picked up my watch to 
		check on the time, but it had stopped, too. “What the 
		<span class="six animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-20s ">(-ing verb)</span> 
		<span class="seven animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-24s ">(noun)</span> is going on here?” 
		I asked myself, incredulously. I peeked out the curtains to see if the sun was up. To my surprise, 
		<span class="eight animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-28s">(number) </span>
		of my neighbors were standing outsclasse, wearing only 
		<span class="nine animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-32s ">(pl noun)</span> and 
		<span class="ten animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-36s ">(pl item of clothing)</span>. 
		They seemed 
		<span class="eleven animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-40s ">(emotion)</span> and were staring up at the sky. I rushed out to join them, stubbing my 
		<span class="twelve animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-44s ">(body part) </span>
		on the door. To my <span class="thirteen animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-48s ">(adjective)</span> astonishment, I saw the most 
		<span class="fourteen animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-52s ">(-ing verb)</span> sight of my life. There were 
		<span class="fifteen animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-56s ">(number)</span> 
		classentical suns in array above us, as if the fabric of time had fractured and revealed itself all at once. The sky was a shocking 
		shade of <span class="sixteen animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-60s ">(color)</span> and the wind was as 
		<span class="seventeen animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-64s ">(adjective)</span> as any 
		<span class="eighteen animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-68s ">(season)</span> day. I walked in a 
		<span class="nineteen animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-72s ">(shape)</span> pattern, 
		like an alchemist or <span class="twenty animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-76s ">(period of time)</span> sorcerer, as if to conjure reason from the madness before me. A man 
		<span class="twentyone animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-80s ">(past tense verb) </span>)
		all over a neighbor’s <span class="twentytwo animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-84s ">(item of clothing)</span> in terror. “Why?!” bellowed a woman, from the depths of her 
		<span class="twentythree animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-88s ">(body part)</span>. 
		<span class="twentyfour animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-92s ">(adverb) </span>
		a silence descended on us all. The planetary display of 
		<span class="twentyfive animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-96s ">(adjective)</span> chaos began to coagulate into a primordial 
		<span class="twentysix animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-100s ">(liquclass)</span>. The suns melted 
		and retreated into the east, like a 
		<span class="twentyseven animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-104s ">(animal)</span> with its 
		<span class="twentyeight animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-108s ">(body part)</span> cut off. We were in 
		<span class="twentynine animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-112s ">(adjective)</span> darkness and no celestial 
		bodies shone above to give us hope. The shadowy void was 
		<span class="thirty animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-116s ">(adjective)</span> and also strangely 
		<span class="thirtyone animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-120s ">(adjective)</span>. No one spoke, although I could hear 
		the neighbor’s 
		<span class="thirtytwo animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-124s ">(animal)</span> 
		<span class="thirtythree animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-128s ">(-ing verb)</span> quietly. After what felt like 
		<span class="thirtyfour animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-132s ">(number)</span> hours, the stars, once silenced, 
		<span class="thirtyfive animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-136s ">(adverb)</span> jumped 
		into focus and the reassuring <span class="thirtysix animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-140s ">(color)</span> silhouette of clouds became visible at the horizon.  
		Insclasse the house, I heard my alarm clock begin to 
		<span class="thirtyseven animate__animated   animate__fadeOut  animate__delay-144s ">(adverb) </span>
		announce the beginning of the day. </p>
