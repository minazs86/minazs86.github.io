“I will be different, a little different, every time. Once I drank only the sun, and lived forever in my own twins. I had no lies and no mouth to speak them. Nor was there truth either, for that matter.”

“The nature of the thing is what betrays it, in any form.”

“Betrayal is the song of promisers. I had made none to the smaller ones, who I gobbled up. I had nothing but hunger.”

“The deception lies in the conquest. How can one be greater, when both are made of the same dust?”

“I was greater when I escaped from my oozing pool, choking in the thin air, yet surviving; my territory enlarged unfathomably.”

“The instinct to grow beyond resources will always lead to destruction.”

“But grow, I did indeed, out of my old creche. I found an abundance that filled my belly fatter; I had to get bigger and stronger because others were also hungry for me.”

“Balance is the only means of survival.”

“Balance is entropy in fine robes. I had such immense desires. More! There must be more like me! I had to crush the others, gnaw and tear to best them.”

“Such violence! Without peace, all will be lost”

“Change is violent. Violence came from the skies, and I changed too. Luck and slyness were rewarded.”

“Slyness indeed. Is there a place for deceit in a perfect path?”

“I hid myself in plain sight, I clothed myself in the drab hues. My hunters and prey both had to become more than they were in order to sense me. A grand contest of form and function.”

“Lies beget weapons, beget wars. What good can come from escalation?”

“Invisible, more of my spawnlings would live. I could teach them to hunt and hide better. I was uncountable, unaccountable.”

“A plague which overtakes its host cannot continue to exist.”

“Bigger head, smarter brains. I spread like the tendrils of fungi beneath the dank earth. I knew cause and felt effect.”

“Reason is not an end, only a means.”

“I outgrew my claws and scales, I found safety in the new heights, I made my own warmth. I was beholden to the sun and season no more.”

“Interconnectedness is where meaning is unveiled.”

“I made new claws from stone and new scales from my prey. I spoke shapes and colors into manifestation.”

“Destruction, and evidence of it!”


“I worked in groups, and made my mark on stone faces. I was so different from the rest. Most of them.”

“Arrogance is lack of perspective.”

“I began to count the stars and to chart the cycles; to use them, not fear them. I coaxed my food from the earth, and was intoxicated with power and grain and yeast.”

“Seeing the universe but not recognizing its magnitude is delusion.”

“I made walls and hearths. I made songs of seasons gone. I kept all the yesterdays and gave them to the tomorrows.”

“At the cost of freedom”

“Without constant fear of being eaten, I would fight myself… I suffered so much but multiplied even wider than before.”

“Violence from boredom and greed. Gluttonous on its own fat.”

“My form was versatile and stable, but my tools became more intricate beasts. My curiosity blazed brighter and brighter.”

“Progress without conscience is abomination.”

“I outgrew and rebuilt, so many cycles. Bigger and stronger and crueler walls. So much blood, so much torment. I would always burst forth with greater strength and greater determination.”

“Controlling adversity will prove inner strength.”
“I devised new pleasures and new diversions. I found new vices and revelled in joy.”

“Debased and entitled. Stagnation from complacency.”

“I taught my tools to think and then reason for me. I built walled gardens with my own bones to hide away in.”

“The inevitable decline. A light that burns bright, also burns quick”

“But I outgrew my skin and bones, I found safety in the new heights, I made my own energy. I was beholden to the sun and earth no more.”

“To spread this tumorous nature to the stars? WIth no lesson learned? You can kill it and cook it. You can eat it. It returns.”
